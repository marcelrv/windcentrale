# Windcentrale

Get data from windcentrale (new API) and post it to a mqtt topic for further processing
This is using the new API / urls as the old urls stopped working.

Unfortunately it requires you to logon using your windcentrale.nl credentials.
Configuration parameters like userid/password, mqtt server details etc in the beginning of the script.
